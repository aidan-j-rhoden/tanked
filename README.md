# tanked

An old-timey, single or two player tank game that may, to some eyes, vaguely resemble Kee Games' Tank. The second player controlled tank is currently missing, though.

Current features:
- Player controlled tank
- CPU controlled tank that chases the player
- Bullets that do not damage anything
- Amazing Game Boy-esque graphics

Controls:
- Movement: Arrow keys
- Shoot: Space
