# Tanked

An old-timey, single or two player tank game that may, to some eyes, vaguely resemble Kee Games' Tank made with the Godot Engine. The second player controlled tank is currently missing, though.

Current features:
- Player controlled tank
- CPU controlled tank that chases the player
- Bullets that do not damage anything
- Amazing Game Boy-esque graphics

Controls:
- Movement: Arrow keys
- Shoot: Space
